# ToonTanks
3D game in Unreal Engine 5 made as part of the GameDev.Tv UE5 C++ Developer course.
In this game, the player controlls a tank that must destroy the enemy turrets while avoiding getting shot by them.

Some of what I learned in this course:

.Creating C++ classes and using inheritance to create pawns like the tank and the enemy turrets;
.Giving controll to the player using the new Enhanced Input System, creating an Input Mapping Context, binding Input Actions to functions in C++
.Creating simple shooting mechanics and a projectile class in C++ with smoke FX applied via Blueprint
.Stablishing a Game Mode with elements like Health, Damage and Destruction of objects in C++
.Connecting UI Widget Blueprints and C++ using UFUNCTION macros and the correct Function Specifiers
.Controlling the spawning of particles, camera movement and sound playback in C++
